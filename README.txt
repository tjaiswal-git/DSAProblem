==========================================Overview of Data Structures===================================================================

A) Data structure is a representation of the logical relationship existing between individual elements of data.
B) Data Structure is a way of organizing all data items that considers not only the elements stored but also their relationship to each other.
C) We can also define data structure as a mathematical or logical model of a particular organization of data items.
D) The representation of particular data structure in the main memory of a computer is called as storage structure.
E) The storage structure representation in auxiliary memory is called as file structure.
F) It is defined as the way of storing and manipulating data in organized form so that it can be used efficiently.
G) Data Structure mainly specifies the following four things
    1) Organization of Data
    2) Accessing methods
    3) Degree of associativity
    4) Processing alternatives for information
H) Algorithm + Data Structure = Program
I) Data structure study covers the following points
    1) Amount of memory require to store.
    2) Amount of time require to process.
    3) Representation of data in memory.
    4) Operations performed on that data.

Note:

This repository is made for practise purpose to solve data structure problem in the real world.
